## Issue: cannot solve the 8th of medium ones

- [x] Code not interpretable: KMeans is not defined (or Kmeans?)
- [ ] LLM answer is unhelpful text

**Fix**: KMeans lib issue solved by adding `from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
` on top of `test_with_golden.py`. Outputs waits for further try.

**Error**:

Current prompt:  Calculate the total byte weight of edges incident on each node, use kmeans clustering to cluster the total byte weights into 5 clusters, apply the cluster labels as strings to the nodes and pick and assign colors to the nodes based on their cluster labels. Shape the data correctly using numpy before passing it to kmeans. Return the networkx graph object.
Find the prompt in the list.

"data": "The operation requested involves executing code to perform k-means clustering and updating a graph object based on the results. As I can't execute code or directly interact with libraries such as numpy or networkx, I'm unable to fulfill this request directly. However, I can guide you through the steps you would take to perform this operation in a Python environment."
